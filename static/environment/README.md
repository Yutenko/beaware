this is the place where all the configs and triggers live
they get loaded on first pageload and stores clientside, so the user can
work offline via an savegame

offline storage can be indexdb or localstorage

most of the configs are results from authoring tools that dont exist yet and are written by hand

we assume, all the authorings tools to be written are placing their final output in this directory

must be a static directory thats not being cached by the compiler
